# Tweet Classifier: Detecting Disasters

The beauty of Twitter is that it offers real-time communication of users. And when a disaster happens, being able to analyze tweets can better assist in responding to the situation. That’s why it’s important for media outlets and disaster relief organizations, like FEMA, to monitor social media. Programming a machine learning model to do this can be difficult. There’s certain words that can mean different things that humans can decipher quicker than a machine. For example, “on fire” can refer to an actual fire, as in “that building is on fire”, or a term used when you eat something spicy, as in “my mouth is on fire”. I believe that there are certain elements in a tweet that a model can recognize to predict whether a tweet is referring to a real disaster, like unique keywords and the length of tweets. The goal of this project is to build a model that can recognize the difference and predict what’s referring to a disaster and what is not.
